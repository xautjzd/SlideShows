SlideShows
==========

It mainly store my slideshow src.

## Tools

The slideshows are written by [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax, created by [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) tool.

There are also similar slideshow tools,such as [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/)、[impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js)、[Rabbit](http://slide.rabbit-shocker.org/en)、[VimDeck](https://github.com/tybenz/vimdeck), etc.But I choose `Remark` beacuse it is so simple to operate.

## Introduction

Vim-introduction.html is slideshow source file. Open it in web-browser,and you will see the slideshow effect.But It have `remark.js` file dependency. Vim-introduction.md is source file I collect snips to use as the vim-slideshow material.
